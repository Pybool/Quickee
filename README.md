# Running Tests on Specific Environments

This project provides convenient scripts for running regression tests on reservations and bookings, as well as generating reports.

## Run Regression Tests for Reservations

To run regression tests specifically for reservations, use the following command:

```bash
npm run start:regression-reservations
```
This command uses Cypress to run automated tests with the @automated tag in headless mode, focusing on the reservations environment.

## Run Regression Tests for Bookings
To run regression tests specifically for bookings, use the following command:
```
npm run start:regression-bookings
```
Similar to the reservations command, this command runs automated tests with the @automated tag in headless mode, focusing on the bookings environment.


## Generate Test Report
To generate a test report, use the following command:

```
npm run generate:report
```
This command executes a Node.js script (cucumber-html-report.js) to generate an HTML report based on the results of your Cypress tests.

# TestRail Integration
This project includes scripts to interact with TestRail.

## Delete All Sections/Folders in TestRail
```bash
node testrail.js --delete
```
## Initialize Top-Level Environment Sections/Folders on TestRail
```bash
node testrail.js --init
```
## Add Sub Sections to Top-Level Folders
```bash
node testrail.js --createsubdirs
```
## Export Tests to Selected Environment
To export tests to a selected environment (e.g., Reservations):

```bash
node testrail.js --export --Reservations
```
## Export and Clear Reports Folder
To export tests to a selected environment and clear the cypress/cucumber-json reports folder after export:

```bash
node testrail.js --export --Reservations cleandir
```
Feel free to customize the README further based on your specific project structure and requirements.
